            <p>IBM has introduced digital credentials as a modern, dynamic way to
                <li>engage you in your skills growth,</li>
                <li>recognize you for your achievements and</li>
                <li>enable you to broadly and easily publicize them.</li>
                <br> Our market, including clients and competitors, is moving quickly to adopt badges and IBM is at the leading
                edge of this in the external market.
                <br> All badge issuer applications are reviewed and prioritized against a set of criteria including resume worthiness,
                skills achievement criteria, strategic skills, high business value and cross BU/ IOT impact.</p>
